# ZimaBoard 2 Homelab

> **A documented, production-style single-node Proxmox homelab built around the IceWhale ZimaBoard 2 (1664).**  
> Designed to be reproducible, hardware-agnostic, and easy to expand.

This repository documents the **architecture**, **design decisions**, and **deployment strategy** behind my personal homelab. While the reference platform is the **ZimaBoard 2 (1664)**, the same blueprint can be recreated on Intel N-series mini PCs, Intel NUCs, SFF desktops, or larger Proxmox servers with only minor hardware adjustments.

Unlike an installation guide, this repository serves as the **platform documentation** for the homelab. Individual services are documented in their own dedicated repositories.

# Companion Repositories

To keep documentation organized, applications are split into dedicated repositories.

| Repository | Covers |
|------------|--------|
| **[ZimaBoard-Media-Stack](https://github.com/Archin3t/ZimaBoard-Media-Stack)** | Movies, TV, and Books — Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, Kavita, Calibre-Web Automated, and LazyLibrarian |
| **[ZimaBoard-NAS (and Everything Else)](https://github.com/Archin3t/ZimaBoard-NAS)** | NAS, OpenMediaVault, storage passthrough, SMB/NFS shares, backups, maintenance, and additional services |

# Reference Hardware

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Model** | IceWhale ZimaBoard 2 (1664) |
| **CPU** | Intel N150 (4 Cores / Up to ~3.6 GHz) |
| **Memory** | 16 GB LPDDR5 |
| **Boot Drive** | 64 GB eMMC (Proxmox OS Only) |
| **Networking** | Dual 2.5 GbE |
| **Storage** | 2× SATA • 2× USB 3.0 |
| **Video Output** | Mini DisplayPort |
| **GPU** | Intel Integrated Graphics (Quick Sync / VAAPI) |

Although this documentation references the **ZimaBoard 2**, the overall architecture applies equally well to:

- Intel N100 / N150 Mini PCs
- Intel NUCs
- Small Form Factor desktops
- Custom Proxmox servers
- Multi-node Proxmox clusters

Scale storage and memory as needed while keeping workload separation intact.

# Design Philosophy

This homelab follows a few simple principles:

- Infrastructure first
- Separate workloads by purpose
- Document everything
- Keep rebuilding simple
- Prefer stability over complexity
- Avoid unnecessary vendor lock-in
- Build for learning without sacrificing reliability

The goal is a platform that remains easy to understand, maintain, and rebuild years later.

# About

This repository documents my personal Proxmox homelab as both a reference implementation and an educational resource.

While the featured hardware is the **IceWhale ZimaBoard 2**, the architecture has been designed to remain hardware-agnostic wherever possible, making it applicable to many different Proxmox systems.
