# ZimaBoard 2 Homelab Blueprint

Public documentation for a **small Proxmox-based Homelab**: media streaming, optional NAS, and a separate books/reading stack.

In my case I am utilizing the ZimaBoard 2 1664 based on x86 Architecture. The following are the contents/specifications of the ZimaBoard 2 1664:

- Intel N150 Quad-Core up to 3.6GHz
- 16GB LPDDR5 4800MHz RAM
- 64GB eMMC Storage
- 2× SATA Ports
- 2× 2.5GbE
- 2× USB 3.0
- 1× Mini DisplayPort

This repository describes **architecture and roles**. Application install details live in companion repos:

## Safety

This project is intentionally **free of secrets**: no passwords, API keys, personal usernames, or private LAN addresses. Use placeholders and set real values only on your own infrastructure.

I try to still show how a user like you could potentially have the system laid out, for example IP Scheme/Subnets, Ports and IP addresses, Usernames and Passwords, Etc.
